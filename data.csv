The group has extensive collaboration with other universities, nationally and internationally. The research is interdisciplinary and has significant funding through e.g. the Swedish Research Councils VR and Formas. Subject area Microbiology and antibiotic resistance Subject area description Most of the resistance genes that cause problems in the clinic today seem to originate from harmless, environmental bacteria. Our group studies the driving forces behind this development, particularly the effects of low levels of antibiotics and antibacterial biocides in wastewaters from hospitals, municipalities and industries (see Larsson’s website). In some sub-projects, we study the evolutionary relationship between resistance genes in environmental bacteria and pathogens, and search for new forms of resistance in different environments using both bioinformatic methods as well different large-scale functional screens. We also study how analyses of resistant bacteria in sewage can inform predictions of the local, clinical resistance situation. A better knowledge about all these processes and drives will be valuable to be assess and respond to threats to our health. We are now looking for a postdoctoral fellow who is interested in taking on the task to experimentally explore the environmental dimensions of antibiotic resistance. Duties Depending on the applicant’s background, he/she is expected to conduct experimental research, addressing one or several of the research areas mentioned above. This could for example include exposing bacteria or more complex microbial communities to different selective agents or mixtures/wastewaters, followed by studies of selection and/or other processes. The work can also involve identifying and characterizing novel, mobile resistance genes in different environments. Methods that could prove valuable include environmental sampling, culturing of bacteria, resistance phenotyping, functional metagenomics, gene expression studies in bacteria, various methods related to recombinant DNA-technology such as vector construction, cloning and induced constitutive and inducible expression of exogenous proteins in bacteria, gene-knockout, inverse PCR, RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, epic-PCR, bioinformatic analyses of DNA-sequence data generated via different technologies, etc. Within the group there is already competence within e.g. bioinformatics, microbiology, molecular biology and environmental sciences, and we collaborate closely with clinicians, analytical chemists as well as with scientists outside the natural science domain. The work is expected to be conducted in collaboration; hence complementary expertise is valuable. The work also includes authoring/co-authoring scientific publications and presenting research at international scientific conferences.

The group has extensive collaboration with other universities, nationally and internationally, not the least with the group of Professor Erik Kristiansson at Chalmers. The research is interdisciplinary and has significant funding through e.g. the Swedish Research Councils VR and Formas. Subject area Bioinformatics and antibiotic resistance Subject area description Most of the resistance genes that cause problems in the clinic today seem to originate from harmless, environmental bacteria. Our group studies the driving forces behind this development, particularly the effects of low levels of antibiotics and antibacterial biocides in wastewaters from hospitals, municipalities and industries (see Larsson’s website). In some sub-projects, we study the evolutionary relationship between resistance genes in environmental bacteria and pathogens, and search for new forms of resistance in different environments using both bioinformatic methods as well different large-scale functional screens. We also study how analyses of resistant bacteria in sewage can inform predictions of the local, clinical resistance situation. A better knowledge about all these processes and drives will be valuable to be assess and respond to threats to our health. We are now looking for a postdoctoral fellow who is interested in taking on the task to experimentally explore the environmental dimensions of antibiotic resistance. Duties Depending on the applicant’s background, he/she is expected to conduct experimental research, addressing one or several of the research areas mentioned above.

Broken barriers: To understand how molecular and structural characteristics of skin and the effect of topical formulations regulate the activity of redox/antioxidant enzymes in the tissue and translate this knowledge into measures, treatments and products for maintaining skin health, thus preventing deterioration and breaking. Main research is done exploiting physico-chemical methods and models of biobarriers and formulations. Ex vivo models of skin and mucosa: To develop advanced ex vivo cell and tissue-derived models enabling multidisciplinary and holistic studies of healthy and disordered skin and mucosa. Microbiota: To develop methods enabling studies of antimicrobials and molecular mechanisms of microbiota’s role in redox homeostasis and immune modulation in biological barriers, especially skin. Sensing: To develop sensing methods enabling (i) wireless detection of microbial overgrowth at biological barriers and wounds, and (ii) relation of general (systemic) health condition to the barrier health status.
