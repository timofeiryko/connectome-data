# Connectome data

## Environment

To reproduce this project, use `env.yml` to create a conda environment with all the dependencies:

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
```

## Project structure

- `main.ipynb`: main notebook with the EDA
- `plot.py`: helper functions for plotting
- `prepare.py`: helper functions for data cleaning and preparation

## Data

For now, the ammount of data is very small, so it is included in the repository, just in `data.sqlite` file.
